# Contributor Code of Conduct
The Minnesota Pollinators GitHub organization is intended to be: a place of learning, a place of understanding, a place of teaching, a place of sharing, and a place of growth. We will do our best, and we will assume others are doing their best.

As contributors and maintainers of projects in the organization, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any project-related channels (GitHub, Slack, mailing lists, Twitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to these projects to do the same. 

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the Minnesota Pollinators organization may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us at mn-pollinators@morris.umn.edu.
